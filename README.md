# lin-sep-clusters

Using np.random.randn() to create two clusters of 100 points each, each representing a different class

Moving the mean of each of these clusters to [-2, -2] and [2, 2] respectively and assigning class -1 and 1.

Combining and shuffling the points from different clusters. Make sure to combine and shuffle the assigned classes accordingly. 

Returning the points and their classes as separate numpy arrays of shape (N, 2) and(N, 1) respectively

Doing same with XOR dataset

Visualise these clusters and their labels as different colors using matplotlib.pyplot.plot

using the scikit-learn library to find a decision boundary to separate clusters.
